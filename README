INSTALLATION

1. Before you begin, backup the original lib.php file found in /lib/editor/tinymce/
2. Copy the lib.php into /lib/editor/tinymce/ replacing the original
3. Open with a text editor lib.php and change the line public $version = '3.4.2'; to the version your Moodle setup is using.
4. Copy the mceconf folder to your moodle /local/ folder
5. Login as an administrator and install.
6. By default all plugins are turned on. You can leave them all enabled or disabled them as you want by checking unchecking the check boxes.
7. If you want to add a plugin, add the plugin in to the proper folder. In this case /lib/editor/tinymce/tiny_mce/3.4.2/plugins/
8. In the settings under Plugins add the plugin name. If you have several plugins, seperate each name with a comma. ex.: phonetic,extension
9. Choose the row you would like the icon to show up in. Add the name of the plugin. If several plugins, use commas to seperate.
   If you want a seperator use |. ex. phonetic,|,extension 
   
Enjoy!
